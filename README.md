# Match3Game

I tried my best to write my code in an OOP. There are cells and candies. The cells are fixed in place, and the candies fall and fill into the cells.
It was necessary for the matches to be easily found. Therefore, candies transform into different types in certain numbers to make matches easier to find.
When a deadlock occurs, the candies transform into new candies that can create a match.

There are 6 different colors of candies in the game, and each candy has 4 different types.

The types of candies change according to their matching levels.

Particle effects appear according to the color of the exploding candies.

We can shape our board however we want. Change its dimensions and use candies in the color you want.
